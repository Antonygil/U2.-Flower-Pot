PROJECT: FLOWER POT
===================
Project description
------------------
The main idea of this project has ecological, economic and educational character.
It is the code we are developing for an autonomous flower pot. The FP is based
on watering systems from farmers' fields but implemented for home. Coding for microcontroller
the project has a physical hardware and it is easy to use. 
The way of coding this microcontroller PIC16F877A is by Assembly language following certain
sintaxys and rules of coding.

How different is our project from the others?
Practically, the conventional watering systems are focused on agriculture and farmers
and their costs are expensive. Our system offers a unique autonomous watering pot 
(the item includes the pot) which works with 5V from the household power outlet. it is
one of the more versions with different sizes and styles.
