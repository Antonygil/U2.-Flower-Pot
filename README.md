PROJECT: FLOWER POT
===================
Project description
------------------
The main idea of this project has ecological, economic and educational character.
It is the code we are developing for an autonomus flower pot. The FP is based
on watering systems from farmers' fields but implemented for home. Coding for microcontroller
the project has a physical hardware and it is easy to use. 
The way of coding this microcontroller PIC16F877A is from Assembly language following certain
sintaxys and rules of coding.
